## TSOLO: The Study of Leaderless Organization

This group is for the discussion of leaderless organizations: flat management, anarchy, consensus, etc., on any scale, from the art collective to the scale of large organizations, or even bigger!

The Study of Leaderless Organization was founded to guide Divdita (http://dividita.org/) using education. It is our hope that TSOLO will help Dividita accomplish its mission of creating a system enabling group decision-making to run an organization, in lieu of representatives/leaders.

It is also our hope that TSOLO benefits the general public in providing education and fostering innovation in the field of leaderless organization.
